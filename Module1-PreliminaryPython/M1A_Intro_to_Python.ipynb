    "\n",
    "Python is ubiquitous in the sciences and data sciences; Particularly prevelant in machine learning applications. It's open source, free, highly modular, and highly readable. Like other high-level programming  languages, Python trades computational efficiency for readability but suits our main goal to introduce relevant concepts for quantitative biology without getting too bogged down in the coding details.\n",

    "Due to being open source, Python has a massive ecosystem of libraries and functionality at its disposal. In this class, we will introduce and use a number of those libraries for numerical methods, statistical analyses, image processing pipelines, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any object that has a ```.__iter__()``` and ```.next()``` method is considered an **iterator**. To put it simply, these are objects that map a given bit of memory and return the desired values one at a time when iterated over. ```zip``` is an example of an iterator. If we call the zip object itself, it doesn't give us the list of tuples we expect, this is because the zip object hasn't been \"exhausted\" by being iterated over. The iterator object has to be called for its length to obtain all its values, hence why we have to convert it to a new list if we want to view it. Til its exhausted its effectively just a pointer to some location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it do this? Well it's saving memory in the background! Calling zip on two objects logically means those objects are already in memory, to make a new object combining them means we are at least doubling the amount of memory right away, instead, zip makes a \"map\" of how to combine these two objects and only really MAKES the new object requested when it is used."

    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are a very powerful way to provide a nonordered method to store information. Dictionaries are \"keyed\" with an object key that goes to some other object. Since its object oriented, a user can match particular objects to other objects. In Python they are denoted by curly brackets in python with pairs of keys and values separated by a colon \":\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries cannot be sliced over, since they have no inherent order. Python stores dictionaries in memory in any order.\n",
