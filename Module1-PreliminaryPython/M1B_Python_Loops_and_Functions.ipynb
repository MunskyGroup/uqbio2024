    "Generators are useful when writing large iterators or handling memory intensive iterable objects. Technically, Generators are subsets of Iterators and are differentiated by having a ```yield``` statement inside their function definition, and are called by ```next```. **You can only iterate once over the generator object!!** For more indepth details you can read their documentation page:\n",

    "The ```map``` function we just went over (as of Python 3.0+) returns an iterator object instead of a list, that is why we converted it to a list to print it out. But we could have just as easily done the following:"
